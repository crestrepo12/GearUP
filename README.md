## Installation Guide

1. Fork Clone Repo
2. Npm install dependencies in the `backend` folder and the `client` folder

## The Journey So Far/ How The App Works

I wanted to build this web application to solve the problem of social workers/case managers/caregivers storing their clients' information in bulky binders. Instead, they can use a virtualized binder on each client and have the ability to find important information more efficiently. They will avoid having them look through a bookshelf filled with the clients' binders and flipping through the many pages stored in them.

### The Future of GearUp

GearUp is still a working progress and will add more features to will seem neccessary especially for the social services industry. These are the following features I'll be looking forward to implement:

- Track clients' goals & annual progress
- upload important documentation (pdf)
- Log in feature for clients' to check their progress
